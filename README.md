# LOAN-status-Model



Loan Status Prediction (Machine Learning Project)

This project aims to predict whether a loan application will be approved or not based on applicant and loan-related features. The workflow covers data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

Key Steps

Data Loading: Imported the loan dataset.

Data Cleaning: Handled missing values for both categorical and numerical features.

Feature Engineering: Encoded categorical variables for machine learning compatibility.

Model Training: Split data into training and testing sets.

Algorithms Used:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Evaluation: Assessed models using Accuracy Score and Classification Report.

Tech Stack

Python, Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, GridSearchCV)

Matplotlib / Seaborn for visualization
